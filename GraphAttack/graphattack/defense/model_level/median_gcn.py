            the dropout ratio of model, by default 0.5
        bias : bool, optional
            whether to use bias in the layers, by default True

            How to apply the normalizer.  Can be one of the following values:

            * ``both``, where the messages are scaled with :math:`1/c_{ji}`, 
            where :math:`c_{ji}` is the product of the square root of node degrees
            (i.e.,  :math:`c_{ji} = \sqrt{|\mathcal{N}(j)|}\sqrt{|\mathcal{N}(i)|}`).

            * ``square``, where the messages are scaled with :math:`1/c_{ji}^2`, where
            :math:`c_{ji}` is defined as above.

            * ``right``, to divide the aggregated messages by each node's in-degrees,
            which is equivalent to averaging the received messages.

            * ``none``, where no normalization is applied.

            * ``left``, to divide the messages sent out from each node by its out-degrees,
            equivalent to random walk normalization.
